# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the updated work was to create a new dataframe with ride sharing statistics. Then we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter notebook.

## Results
For this analysis, we compared the total fares, total drivers, total rides, average fare per ride and the average fare per driver for the different city types.
The urban population had by far the most buiness. There were 2.6x and 13x more rides than Suburban and Rural communities respectively. For total fares, they generated just under $40,000, which was over 9x the Rural amount and over 2x the Suburban amount. However, Urban areas had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver which may be due to the length of trips or the lack of drivers in the Rural and Suburban areas.

## Summary
Based on the results, here are 3 business recommendations I have to address the disparities among the city types:
1. We can hire more drivers in rural and suburban areas to reduce costs of rides and increase availability of drivers. This may make rides more appealing since the cost for the rider will go down and the wait times won't be as long.
2. There is space to offer more rides in Urban communities. There are currently more drivers than rides being taken which is a problem that needs to be addressed. I have two suggestions to help accomodate this:
  - Advertise in Urban areas more. The brand will become better known and more relevant and the increase in rides will offset advertising costs.
  - Lower ride costs to make them more appealing. Our goal will be to gather enough new business that it will compensatate for the decrease in fare prices and the overall revenue will increase.
3.In rural areas, it may be hard to hire new drivers due to lack of interest. In this case, we could attempt to increase fare rates to raise our profits.
