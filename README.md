# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the updated work was to create a new dataframe with ride sharing statistics. Then we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter notebook.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

For this analysis, we compared the total fares, total drivers, total rides, average fare per ride and the average fare per driver for the different city types.
The urban population had by far the most buiness. There were 2.6x and 13x more rides than Suburban and Rural communities respectively. For total fares, they generated just under $40,000, which was over 9x the Rural amount and over 2x the Suburban amount. However, Urban areas had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver which may be due to the length of trips or the lack of drivers in the Rural and Suburban areas.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- more drivers to reduce costs in rural and suburban
- can give more rides in urban - lower costs to make rides more appealing while aiming to increase total revenue or advertise more
- In rural, if no opportunity to hire new drivers or produce more rides, increase fare amounts
- advertise
